Frightening and embarrassing
Like one percent and pleasantries
Gather your things bolt till you reach
The crystal fields of ketamine
I'll meet you there, I'll beat you there
Bet I'll be there before you leave
Time you get there Iâ€™ll be midair
Like peace of mind's a bore to me

The fear
The fear
Jump, jump
DON'T JUMP!

When the rail holds you
Flight like stairs grows you
Off your mind must wish
This is not my ditch
Ah that ditch wears you
Host torn and worn through
Hard looks at blank walls
Held way too long pause
The fear
The fear

Downs you with dull pain
Hello Odin!
Tied up with your legs
Hide helps, on the way
Who will help you fall?
It's just all so frail
So long since we fell
Still don't know we failed
Go for the most tears
Stay cause it gets strange
Went there to shed years
Left there in lead chains
Been there since next year
Scarred us to death chair
Scared us to rest less
Skull full of house guests
